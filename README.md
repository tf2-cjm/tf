# tf
custom configuration for my tf2 client, not being hosted by steam cloud, therefore sharable and reproducable onto any computer

# os
* windows 10

# hardware
* cm per 360: 74.220779
* mouse: ec2-c 3200 dpi, 0.175 in tf2 raw input on
* first notch on windows mouse settings, enhanced mouse precision off

# terminology
* real tf folder: the tf folder located in your installation of steam
* this tf folder: the tf folder that's hosted on github only containing config files and not extraneous game files

# usage
* clone this to somewhere easily accessible, but not in the game's installation files

## initial tf2 install
* after you initially install tf2 for the first time, copy and paste the files in this tf folder into your real tf folder

## after doing the above
* you update files in your real tf folder over time by editing the configuration files and dragging in custom things
* after that you copy over the files from your real tf folder into this tf folder updating anything here and git pushing
* by doing this you keep your configuration ready for any new computer or setup you come across
